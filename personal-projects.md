# Personal Coding Projects 

I have decided to write down some advice that I would've like to receive when I was building up my junior resume.
These are my personal opinions, feel free to read through the article and decide for yourself what to include in your projects. They should give you a general idea of the things you may encouter in your first job as a Java Developer.


#### A personal coding project for enriching your resume should be:
- **Accesible**  -  Keep your source code up to date on a public repository. This way the interviewer can see the code itself and also that you can work with Git. Having the app deployed to some free hosting platform such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) would be a plus.
- **Complete** - Working software! Start from a small/simple idea and add more complex features along the way. Use feature branches and make sure you can allways start the app from the master branch easily, for a quick demo.
- **Original** -  Avoid mimicking endless online tutorials - you'll end up with the exact same projects as everybody else and you will not learn much from them! Instead, try making the project about yourself: about things you are passionate about. It can be something about the sport you practice, the music you listen to or about coding itself.
- **Realistic** - It should have a purpose and a real world application.
- **Clean** - This is the code the interviewer will look at, try to keep it as clean and well organized as possible. If you are not sure about it, read some articles about coding conventions and best practices and double-check if you are following them. Asking a friend who is already working as developer for a code-review might be a good idea! If you don't know whom to ask, send me a message - I'll be happy to take a look!
 
#### Technica-wise, here are some things that you might want to include in your projects:
- **Spring Boot** - Try sticking to Spring Boot apps for your personal projects. It is demanded, it will make things easier and you'll find a lot of documentation and examples.
- **Web Application** - A web application will have a higher impact on the interviewer. Read about the best practices of for a REST API and try to apply them.
- **Database** - Try to use a database rather than file or memory storage. There are different types of databases, be aware of your choice: the interviewer might ask you what was your reasoning.
- **Configuration and Logging** - Don't hardocde things inside your app, move them to configuration files. Add some logging in the key areas of your service. The interviewer will look for these two and they are easy to add!
- **Clean Code** - Read about design patterns and try to use one or two if you find the proper place for them (but don't force it). Also read some articles about O.O.P. and SOLID principles and check if you respect them.
- **Tests** - You don't need a big coverage, just a couple of tets to prove you know what they are and to show that your code is decoupled and testable. Using Mockito, Wiremock or in-memory database in some of the tests would be a plus.
- **UI** - If you will have a web page, try to keep it simple (I'd say Bootstrap + vanilla JavaScript). The main focus should be on the backend. If not, you will need some oher way of presenting your data: one option would be SwaggerUI. Other idea is to provide a Postman or Insomnia project that can be easily impoorted and used as client.
- **3rd party API** - Integrate your app with a 3rd party API. Do you like running or cycling? Check out the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/). There are a lot of free APIs that you can use, you can find a list [here](https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists). If you have never used an external API before, try using those with no authentification needed.
- **Security** - It can be used either for your own endpoints or for integrating with 3rd parties. It can be something simple such as Basic Authentication or you can use OAuth and an identity provider.

 
PS: The list may go on with a lot of other examples. Make sure you're not diving too deep in any of the subjects - unless you are doing it on purpose ðŸ™‚ The idea is to prove you understand these concepts and technologies involved and that you know how to use them.

PS2: Try not to tick all the boxes from the first go. You can start simple and then build on top of what you have.
